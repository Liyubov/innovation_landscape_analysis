"One major problem with adenovirus gene therapy has been the T-cell mediated immune response elicited by inoculation of adenovirus, which leads to rapid clearance of the virus and loss of transgene expression. In the instant invention, the immune response to a virus is prevented by pre-treatment with adenovirus, adenoassociated virus or herpes virus infected antigen-presenting cell (APC) expressing Fas ligand with induced T-cell tolerance. Administration of AdCMVLacZ after tolerance resulted in prolonged expression of LacZ in tolerized animals compared to control treated animals. In control, but not tolerized animals, there was proliferation of CD3+ T-cell in the spleen in response to AdCMVLacZ treatment. Tolerance induction is also indicated by decreased production of interferon-&ggr; and IL-2 by peripheral T-cells isolated from treated animals after stimulation with the adenovirus infected APCs.

"An axial-gap type storage disk drive motor and storage disk drive configuration is disclosed. The motor includes a stator around retaining cylinder retaining a support sleeve, a storage-disk-carrying rotor, and radial and thrust bearings having striation patterns on the bearing surfaces to develop controlled radial and thrust load-bearing dynamic pressure in an intervening lubricating fluid. The thrust bearing is formed between the upper end of the support sleeve and the rotor. A set of salient poles projecting axially inward is furnished on a bottom face of the rotor hub, axially opposing the stator. The configuration establishes a reluctance type motor: energizing the stator magnetically attracts axially the salient poles on the rotor hub in imparting rotational power thereto. Meanwhile, the magnetic attractive force imparted in the rotor is designed to balance the thrust load-bearing pressure generated in the thrust bearing. The configuration enables the motor to be made thinner and eliminates the need for rotor magnets, curtailing the number of parts, reducing costs, and preventing magnetic contamination caused by magnetic powder/particles from the motor.","Motor for driving storage disks, and storage disk drive device provided therewith",F16C

"An improved non-obtrusive weapon detection system and method used in discriminating between a concealed weapon made of a ferromagnetic material. The system provides a high probability of detection of hand guns and other types of weapons with a low false alarm rate. The detection of the weapon is accomplished by measuring a total electromagnetic field. The total field being the sum of an incident electromagnetic field and an electromaetic field scattered from the object. The system uses a magnetic field transmitter, which transmits a low intensity electromagnetic signal. The electromagnetic signal illuminates a volume wherein the weapon, called a target, may or may not be carried by a person. The electromagnetic signal is in a form of a sudden steplike change in a constant magnetic field, called a &#8220;time-domain&#8221; excitation. The waveform or step pulse of the time-domain excitation is called a Heaviside step pulse. The step pulse creates two signals, which are analyzed and digitally processed using a preprogrammed computer. The analyzed information allows an observer to identify the target as being threatening or non-threatening.",Non-obtrusive weapon detection system,G01V

" Chimney-like cooling passages that have opposite outlet and inlet end regions open to ambient air also have central regions that extend through heated components of industrial furnaces. The passages preferably are defined by conduits that are oriented and configured in a manner that enables thermally induced flows of ambient air to self establish through the conduits to cool the furnace components once the furnace components become heated. The passages function like chimneys, with each having its outlet located higher than its inlet so that ambient air will effectively rise as it flows from the inlet to the outlet. The passages may provide increases in cross-sectional area somewhere along their lengths so that heated ambient air expanding in the passages is encouraged to discharge from the less restrictive, larger area outlets rather than from the smaller area inlets. If the passages are defined by conduits formed from high heat resistant metal such as stainless steel, and if the conduits have central regions that are embedded in furnace components formed from cast refractory materials, end regions of the conduits may be connected to a framework that supports the cast refractory components, whereby the conduits serve both to cool and to mount the cast refractory components on the framework.

Resistivity values from 10.sup.4 to 10.sup.10 Ohm-cm have been measured for Ti-Cr-Al-O film <1 .mu.m thick. The film resistivity can be discretely selected through control of the target composition and the deposition parameters. The application of Ti-Cr-Al-O as a thin film resistor has been found to be thermodynamically stable, unlike other metal-oxide films. The Ti-Cr-Al-O film can be used as a vertical or lateral resistor, for example, as a layer beneath a field emission cathode in a flat panel display; or used to control surface emissivity, for example, as a coating on an insulating material such as vertical wall supports in flat panel displays.

"A system and method are disclosed for identifying useless or insignificant documents in a document hit list assembled from documents stored in one or more document collection databases. A search engine is used to compose the document hit list based on a query presented by a user. A text extraction algorithm run by a processor is then used to process the documents identified by the document hit list to produce a table of terms and their corresponding collection-level importance ranking called the IQ or Information Quotient. The text algorithm also produces a table of the most important terms per document. The documents are also scanned independently and a table of documents with filenames and lengths is also produced. A summarizing text algorithm is also run by a processor against the documents of the document hit list to produce a table of terms having a high tf*idf value for each document.

"The teachings of the present invention aid a user in attaining an ergonomic position with respect to a remote object such as a display screen (e.g., VDT) or a manufacturing tool. To that end, various mechanisms which feedback to the viewer information related to position and orientation are taught. A first aspect incorporates a feedback mechanism into a display screen. The feedback mechanism could be formed in a variety of manners. In one embodiment, four lights are arranged such that a viewer in the proper orientation will perceive all four lights. However, as the viewer's orientation varies, one or more of the lights is concealed, thereby indicating to the user that the orientation is improper. In another embodiment, the cluster of lights is replaced with a cluster of four distinct pieces of diffraction grating. The diffraction grating could be such that the intensity of the reflected light varies as the viewer's orientation varies. Alternatively, a hologram could arranged such that the image presented to the viewer changes, even presenting informative text to the viewer. Another aspect of the present invention teaches a feedback mechanism that further provides visual feedback regarding position information. In one embodiment, a strip of diffraction grating or other suitable material is applied upon the display screen. The strip is formed such that depending upon the viewers position, the viewer perceives a certain image (e.g., ""20 Inches,"" the color green).",Ergonomic systems and methods for operating computers,G06F

The feedback mechanism could be formed in a variety of manners. In one embodiment, four lights are arranged such that a viewer in the proper orientation will perceive all four lights. However, as the viewer's orientation varies, one or more of the lights is concealed, thereby indicating to the user that the orientation is improper. In another embodiment, the cluster of lights is replaced with a cluster of four distinct pieces of diffraction grating. The diffraction grating could be such that the intensity of the reflected light varies as the viewer's orientation varies. Alternatively, a hologram could arranged such that the image presented to the viewer changes, even presenting informative text to the viewer. Another aspect of the present invention teaches a feedback mechanism that further provides visual feedback regarding position information. In one embodiment, a strip of diffraction grating or other suitable material is applied upon the display screen. The strip is formed such that depending upon the viewers position, the viewer perceives a certain image (e.g., ""20 Inches,"" the color green).",Ergonomic systems and methods for operating computers,G06F

"A contact is defined by an opening etched into borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) down to a silicon substrate. In a contact cleaning process designed to remove native oxide at the bottom of the contact with little effect on the BPSG, the contact is dipped in an etch retardant before being dipped in a cleaning solution containing both the etch retardant and an etchant. The dip in etch retardant modifies the surface of the BPSG, thereby lessening the enhanced etching experienced during the initiation of the dip into the etchant/etch retardant cleaning solution. Results of a etchant/etch retardant clean, both with and without the prepassivation, can be illustrated on a graph depicting the change in contact diameter as a function of dip time. Specifically, the results define &#8220;best fit&#8221; lines on that graph. For a given dip time, a first line representing the prepassivation+etchant/etch retardant clean is 30 to 40 Angstroms lower than a second line representing the prior art clean using the etchant/etch retardant without prepassivation.

To allow multiple simultaneous CBR (constant-bit-rate) voice connections to be supported by a cable modem, when only a single channel can be accessed at a time, a method to select an upstream channel and assign to each connection a time slot in the upstream channel is provided. Jitter, i.e. packet delay variation, results when packets associated with a voice connection are not received at expected intervals. To maintain jitter within predetermined tolerances, the sequence of mini-slots in an upstream channel is divided into frames. Each frame will have a sequence of voice and data-only regions, and the voice region is divided into non-overlapping jitter windows of generally equal length. Even when an upstream channel change is required, each active voice connection is maintained in one of the jitter windows, thereby limiting jitter to the duration of a jitter window.",Upstream bandwidth allocation for packet telephony in a shared-media packet-switched access network,H04L

The container may include two or more subchambers, each of which includes its own separate inflation/deflation valve. The material used is employed in sufficient thickness to provide sufficient strength to resist damage from chewing or scratching by the mother or her puppies. The container has a floor partially defined by an inflation chamber to provide cushioning for the mother and puppies within the container. The top surface of the container overhangs the periphery of the floor to define a peripheral chamber about the periphery of the floor. This peripheral chamber serves the purpose of providing a place where a puppy can escape if the mother is in a position where she might roll over the puppy and otherwise smother it. Two sets of vents extend through walls of the container to vent the peripheral chamber to atmosphere. Thus, if a puppy enters the peripheral chamber either to rest or to escape the mother who is rolling over to a location where she might overlie the puppy, these vents provide air flow into the peripheral chamber so that the puppy can survive being located therein.

"For a cache-coherent controller for a multiprocessor system sharing a cache memory, a split pending buffer having two components: a fully-associative part and an indexed part that can easily be made multi-ported. The associative part, PBA, include multiple entries having a valid bit and address fields, and the indexed part, PBC, includes entries including all the other status fields (i.e., the content part of the pending buffer entries). The split multi-ported pending buffer enables one request and one or more responses to be handled concurrently. Handling a request requires an associative lookup of PBA, a possible directory lookup, a possible read of PBC (in case of collision), and after processing the request in a request protocol handling unit, a possible PBA update, a possible PBC update, and a possible directory update, depending upon the cache coherence protocol implemented.

"The present invention discloses a color CRT system that can be easily adapted for installations in either the northern or the southern hemisphere. The CRT is symmetrical with respect to its yamming or set up for the earth's magnetic field so the CRT can be installed in either a normal or an inverted orientation. Likewise the yoke and yoke connector are designed and can be easily installed so the CRT scan starts in the upper left of the CRT in either the normal or inverted installation. The connectors for the neck video card are designed to exit the side of the card so the wires can be routed to the CRT system card in either CRT installation orientation. Finally the anode wire is made with a length and attachment point such that the anode is wireable when the CRT is in the normal or inverted orientation. Also disclosed are visual orientation markings on the CRT, the yoke and yoke connectors and the neck video card connectors so it is easy to visually see when all elements are correctly installed for either the northern or the southern hemisphere installations.",Multi-hemisphere color CRT,H04N

"A finite state machine is implemented by encapsulating the portions of a state table, which are associated with each state in a state object. Each state object is instantiated when the associated state is entered and destroyed when the state is exited. Since memory is only allocated at runtime when an object is instantiated and in existence, the amount of memory required to implement the state table is minimized. The state class from which the state object is instantiated can be subclassed. In accordance with normal object-oriented class design, a subclass inherits the state table of its parent class. However, the subclass allows table rows to be added and table rows present in the parent class to be overwritten in the subclass.

"A method is provided for utilizing a memory system which allows for the fast and efficient writing and reading of objects to and from diverse memory chips. A computer system and memory system complex according to method is also provided. The invention defines objects in terms of &#8220;shapes.&#8221; The shape of an object is defined by two parameters: &#8220;Width&#8221; and &#8220;Height.&#8221; Memory system memory chips may comprise sets of different kinds of memory modules which vary in terms of access speed, latency and memory width, such as for example DRAM or SRAM memory modules. The Height of an object denotes the number of consecutive address locations at which the object is stored on a memory module. The Width of an object denotes the number of memory modules at which the object is stored. An advantage of the invention is that objects are defined in terms of &#8220;sub-objects&#8221; optimized for the memory system memory modules. The sub-objects match the line-width of the memory, thereby allowing the objects to be efficiently written to different memories or memory banks. A further advantage of the invention is that the sub-object shape is transparent to the requester (i.e. transparent to application assembly language). A further advantage of the invention is that sub-objects are handled independently by the memory arbiter, i.e. they can be written to the memory or read from the memory in any order. The complex may further comprise a Tree Search Memory (TSM) system that utilizes a &#8220;tree&#8221; object hierarchy to perform high-speed memory lookups. Shaping is used to specify how an object is stored in the TSM. The trees consist of different kinds of objects with different shapes.

"A maskless, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system uses microlens arrays to focus EUV radiation (at an operating wavelength of 11.3 nm) onto diffraction-limited (58-nm FWHM) focused spots on a wafer printing surface. The focus spots are intensity-modulated by means of microshutter modulators and are raster-scanned across a wafer surface to create a digitally synthesized exposure image. The system uses a two-stage microlens configuration to achieve both a high fill factor and acceptable transmission efficiency. EUV illumination is supplied by a 6 kHz xenon plasma source, and the illumination optics comprise an aspheric condenser mirror, a spherical collimating mirror, and two sets of flat, terraced fold mirrors that partition the illumination into separate illumination fields covering individual microlens arrays. (The system has no projection optics, because the image modulator elements are integrated with the microlens arrays.) The printing throughput is estimated to be 62 (300-mm) wafers per hour (assuming a resist exposure threshold of 20 mJ/cm2), and print resolution is estimated at 70 nanometers for mixed positive- and negative-tone patterns (at k1=0.6).","Maskless, microlens EUV lithography system",G02B

"A method of and program for dynamically testing a buffering and selection device, wherein the buffering and selection device receives a transmission at an average bandwidth of T and in peak bandwidth bursts that may be greater than T, are provided. The buffering and selection device transmits data to one or more receive devices, all of which have a total average bandwidth of at least T. The buffering and selection device has buffers apportioned to each receive device in order to store data that is written in burst mode destined for that receive device. The method includes disabling the output data flow to the receive device being tested and then generating input data to the buffering and selection device tagged for each receive device in burst mode at a preselected number of transfers for each receive device. The program determines when the preselected number of transfers has occurred and then enables data flow to the receive device being tested. It is then determined if output to each receive device has commenced within a preselected latency period, and, if it has, it is determined if the preselected number of transfers of data has occurred within a preselected transfer period, i.e., meets bandwidth requirements.",Verifying performance of a buffering and selection network device,H04L

"Disease cased by papilloma virus is treated by applying an effective amount of Mycobacterium to the region of infection. Specifically, condylomata acuminata are caused by human papilloma virus infection. Despite numerous treatment modalities these patients often demonstrate recurrent disease. BCG therapy is used in primary treatment or in patients not responding to or recurrent after standard treatment. Six men with rapidly recurrent external and intraurethral condylomata acuminata underwent BCG therapy after initial laser treatment. External application and intraurethral instillation of BCG was performed six times in weekly intervals. Follow-up studies included examination and endoscopic inspection of the urethra and bladder. Three patients completed one course of BCG and had no relapse of condylomata acuminata. Two patients underwent a second course of BCG, of whom one relapsed. One patient relapsed after discontinued therapy due to penile edema. The annual recurrence rate decreased from 3.2 before the BCG therapy to 0.75 after BCG therapy (p<0.05, test of equality of 2 percentages). In addition, eight men underwent BCG therapy as primary therapy without initial laser treatment, following the same course of treatment, but employing BCG in a cream with salicylic acid to promote keratolysis. Six out of eight patients completely recovered. The BCG-induced immune response appears to reduce the recurrence rate in patients with condylomata acuminata.",Treatment of papilloma virus infection using a mycobacterium,A61K

"The invention relates to a compact and cost-effective diode-split high-voltage transformer for high voltages of, in particular, above 20 kV, in which the high-voltage winding lies in chambers of a coil former underneath the primary winding and which contains elements by which the electric field between the coil former and the core is reduced in order to avoid corona effects. These elements include, for example, a conductive coating of the surface of the inner cavity of the coil former, which coating preferably comprises colloidal graphite. The conductive coating may also be realized by a metallized plastic film which is wound between the core and the coil former. Alternatively, the cavity between the core and the coil former may be filled with a material whose relative permittivity &#8712;r is distinctly greater than that of air. The use of a larger number of diodes is also possible for reducing the electric field.

" A method and apparatus for evaluating the end cap round transducer horn assemblies used in debubbling operations wherein the ECR THA can be evaluated off-line at both high and low power and on-line by making electrical measurements on the ECR THA. The electrical measurements are used to characterize the physical condition of the piezoelectric ceramics of the THA. A test box is employed to practice the method. The test box is connected between the THA and a signal analyzer. Power is supplied to the THA and the electrical signals across the THA are sampled. The sampled electrical signals are transmitted to the signal analyzer while maintaining the amplitude and phase relationship thereof. The sampled electrical signals are used to generate an impedance trace for the particular THA. That impedance trace is compared to a model impedance trace. In such manner, it can be determined whether the ECR THA is operational. Further, if the ECR THA is in working condition, the impedance trace can be used to determine how efficiently it is operating. This allows for an ultimate determination to be made of how well a particular ECR THA is functioning. ",Apparatus for testing transducer horn assembly debubbling devices,G01H

" A container filled with a freezable mixture for use in refrigeration or temporary cooling purposes. The container of the invention is generally one of the common metal cylindrical containers or cans but may also include both plastic and glass bottles. Normally such containers are unsuitable for holding a freezable mixture due to the expansion of the freezing mixture causing the deformation or rupture of said container. By using a fully soluble eutectic mixture, such as propylene glycol and water mixed at a ratio of 20% propylene glycol, an ice slurry is formed at the temperatures normally present in home freezers. A small gas space is also needed for expansion and contraction of the container contents. When a can or other inwardly flexible container is utilized, a positive pressure within the container, relative to the external pressure, can be maintained with a gas charge. Alternative to the use of a fully soluble eutectic mixture and a gas space, a compressible member may be inserted into the container to protect the container from the expansion and contraction of the freezing liquid.

"A Java virtual machine 2, comprises an execution engine for executing Java byte code and a memory management system 14. The memory management system 14 performs garbage collection to remove objects that are not reachable from the current state of the Java program. In the prior art memory management system objects representing a class definition are only removed from memory if the classloader object which has loaded the class object is not reachable. According to the present invention the memory management system 14 is arranged for removing classes which do not have any instantiated objects which can be reached in the present state of the program even if the classloader is still reachable. This results in a substantial saving of memory. Preferably the objects representing a class definition have a method which can signal to it that the definition can be deleted from memory if it has no instantiated objects anymore.",Arrangement for executing program code with reduced memory requirements,G06F

" Method for warping with a cone sectional warping machine, which winds threads in bands on a warping drum, wherein a support for a thread guide comb and the warping drum are displaced in relation to each other in correspondence with the increasing thickness of winding and predetermined warping data. The first band is monitored during a first measuring phase by a roll exerting contact pressure and the monitored displacement path is recorded as a function of the number of rotations of the warping drum. Roll pressure on the winding during the measuring phase is continuously monitored using measuring techniques. Displacement of the support is corrected if monitoring results differ from a predetermined setpoint. In order to even out the formation of the wind, the roll is arranged at a given distance from the warping drum when warping of the first band is started.

" An information processing system wherein a module to operate as a master which executes a read access to a module to operate as a slave requests a bus arbiter to afford the mastership of a bus with a bus mastership request signal, and it simultaneously asserts a last cycle signal so as to notify the bus arbiter of the fact that the next cycle will be the last cycle to be used by the master. Subsequently, when the master has had the use of the bus granted by a bus use grant signal from the bus arbiter, it transfers an address to the slave by the use of the bus in the next cycle, thereby starting the read access. After the read access, the master releases the bus mastership. Only when the slave has failed to accept the transferred address, does it assert a retry request signal two cycles after the transfer cycle of the address not accepted. In this case, the module having executed the transfer two cycles before the cycle of the asserted signal executes again the transfer executed before. Thus, the address to be transferred can be transferred to the module ready to accept the address, in only one cycle.

"In a dual-damascene method for forming an integrated circuit with copper conductors, a fluorinated silicon oxide (SiOF) marker layer is formed between an intermetal silicon dioxide layer and an upper silicon dioxide layer. A plasma etch forms trenches (as sited for future copper conductors) in the upper silicon dioxide layer according to a pattern defined by a photoresist mask. During this trench etch, the spectral characteristics of the plasma are monitored. After the marker layer is exposed and etching of the SiOF begins, an optical spectral detector detect is an enhancement of a spectral signal associated with fluorine ions. This detection is used in determining when to terminate the trench etch. A further photolithographic step results in via apertures. The trenches are then filled with copper. The resulting structure includes marker material in areas protected by the trench etch mask. However, because the dielectric constant of fluorinated silicon oxide (k=3.3-3.6) is lower than that of the main dielectric material, silicon dioxide (k=4), the marker material does not adversely affect the parasitic capacitance of the integrated circuit. Thus, the marker material provides for precise control of trench depth without adversely affecting device performance.",Spectrally detectable low-k dielectric marker layer for plasma-etch of integrated-circuit structure,H01L

" A coupling tool for a double wall is proposed which makes it possible to join an inner and an outer wall together without selecting places while ensuring a sufficient joint strength. The coupling tool is formed by an anchor formed by superposing two metallic plates so as to be spreadable, and a wire of a required length mounted to one end of the anchor. The wire is fixed to the anchor so as to protrude from an end opposite to the tip of the anchor. Since the anchor can be driven into the inner wall at any position, the outer wall can be fixed to the inner wall by use of the coupling tool without selecting places and number.

"In an image reading apparatus, for reading in the color mode, outputs of even-number pixels and odd-number pixels of respective color components output from a CCD line sensor are time shared and multiplexed at selectors and are sent to A/D converters, respectively. When reading in the monochrome mode, the selectors select the row of odd-number pixels and the row of even-number pixels of a color component selected as the dropout color, and the even-number pixels and the odd-number pixels of the color component are separately converted by individual A/D converters into digital signals.

"A method and system for generating and transmitting optical signals with only one sideband. Single-sideband optical signal transmission reduces the signal impairment effects associated with dispersion. Such transmission also increases the spectral efficiency of optical transmission systems. Single-sideband modulation also makes possible electrical compensation for optical link dispersion during transmission. Single-sideband modulation is generated using the modulating data signal and its Hilbert transform, which is approximated by a tapped-delay time filter. Line coding is used to remove the low-frequency content in the modulating data signal, avoiding the inefficiencies of tapped-delay-line filter approximated Hilbert transformers at low frequencies.

"The present invention provides for a system and method for improvement of radio transmitter and receiver frequency accuracy for a local radio communication unit that communicates digital data with a remote communication unit. In the local unit the received radio signal is down-converted, and converted to complex baseband digital samples by an analog-to-digital converter. A downlink digital phase rotator applies a fine frequency shift to the samples in accordance with a receiver frequency offset command. The resultant baseband signal is used by the data demodulator and by a receiver frequency error estimator to obtain receiver frequency errors. A data modulator generates baseband complex samples which are shifted in carrier frequency by an integrated uplink digital phase rotator in accordance with a transmitter frequency offset command. The modulated samples are then converted by a digital-to-analog converter and upconverted in frequency for radio transmission to the remote unit. The local oscillator signals for both upconverter and downconverter are phase locked to a reference frequency generated by a VCXO. An automatic frequency control (AFC) function nulls the transmitter and receiver frequency error by the frequency adjustment commands to the uplink and downlink phase rotators or to the VCXO digital-to-analog converter (VCXO DAC) by feedback control principals based on measured receiver frequency error. During frequency track mode when communications between local and remote units are possible, the AFC only adjusts radio frequency via phase rotator commands and the VCXO command remains fixed, thereby avoiding communications performance degradation by VCXO frequency quantization error due to the VCXO DAC. The AFC adjusts VCXO frequency only during a preliminary acquisition mode prior to data communications, or to back out excessively large frequency offsets accumulated in the downlink and uplink phase rotators during track mode.

"A receiver and a phase extraction circuit are capable of demodulating at high resolution if the sampling frequency is close to the frequency of received signal. In the phase extraction circuit, the received signal modulated in phase is sampled when lowered to an intermediate frequency. When the sampling frequency at this time is selected around the intermediate frequency, a continuous portion appears in one position of the sampling data row. The position of the continuous portion is determined by the phase of the received signal, and therefore a one-to-one correspondence table of the continuous position and phase of received signal is prepared. By detecting the continuous position, the phase information can be obtained from the table. As a result, it is possible to demodulate directly at the intermediate frequency, and therefore the circuit scale is substantially simplified, the number of parts is curtailed, and the size is reduced.",Receiver and phase extraction circuit,H04L

" A method and apparatus for evaluating the end cap round transducer horn assemblies used in debubbling operations wherein the ECR THA can be evaluated off-line at both high and low power and on-line by making electrical measurements on the ECR THA. The electrical measurements are used to characterize the physical condition of the piezoelectric ceramics of the THA. A test box is employed to practice the method. The test box is connected between the THA and a signal analyzer. Power is supplied to the THA and the electrical signals across the THA are sampled. The sampled electrical signals are transmitted to the signal analyzer while maintaining the amplitude and phase relationship thereof. The sampled electrical signals are used to generate an impedance trace for the particular THA. That impedance trace is compared to a model impedance trace. In such manner, it can be determined whether the ECR THA is operational. Further, if the ECR THA is in working condition, the impedance trace can be used to determine how efficiently it is operating.

"A sensor system utilizing a Composite Hough Transform (CHT) operates on multiple corresponding broadband correlograms produced at two neighboring dual-channel sensor systems. A broadband signal source can generate one correlation trace on each of the correlograms. Since these correlation traces are produced by the same signal source, they are constrained by a set of geometric relationships. By fully exploiting this set of constraints, the CHT fuses sensor data from multiple dual-channel sensor systems for target detection and track parameter estimation. The dual-channel system can be (a) a split-array system; a linear array split into two subarrays with each subarray corresponding to one of the channels, (b) two neighboring linear arrays, or (c) two neighboring individual hydrophones. The CHT operates with two neighboring linear subarrays. One of the sensor arrays is chosen as the primary array; it is used to originate the different track hypotheses for the signal source. Its corresponding broadband correlogram is referred to as the primary correlogram. The other sensor array is the secondary array, and the corresponding broadband correlogram is referred to as the secondary correlogram. The CHT exploits the geometric relationships between the primary and secondary array.",Composite hough transform for multitarget multisensor tracking,G01S

The test box is connected between the THA and a signal analyzer. Power is supplied to the THA and the electrical signals across the THA are sampled. The sampled electrical signals are transmitted to the signal analyzer while maintaining the amplitude and phase relationship thereof. The sampled electrical signals are used to generate an impedance trace for the particular THA. That impedance trace is compared to a model impedance trace. In such manner, it can be determined whether the ECR THA is operational. Further, if the ECR THA is in working condition, the impedance trace can be used to determine how efficiently it is operating.

"An electrolyte is employed to test for defects in bare printed circuit boards. A bare board under test is placed in a conductive tank and immersed in an electrolyte. A probe is then used to contact a pad of a net to be tested on the board. The electrical resistance is then measured across the net and the electrolyte, the magnitude of the resistance being related to the number of pads actually connected to the net. The measurement thus provides an indication of whether the correct number of pads have been detected. Defects on the board, such as unintended short circuits and open circuits, cause the number of pads detected to be different from the expected value, thereby affecting the measured resistance.",Apparatus and method for electrolytic bare board testing,G01R

" A highly damped kinematic coupling for precision instruments. The kinematic coupling provides support while causing essentially no influence to its nature shape, with such influences coming, for example, from manufacturing tolerances, temperature changes, or ground motion. The coupling uses three ball-cone constraints, each combined with a released flexural degree of freedom. This arrangement enables a gain of higher load capacity and stiffness, but can also significantly reduce the friction level in proportion to the ball radius divided by the distance between the ball and the hinge axis. The blade flexures reduces somewhat the stiffness of the coupling and provides an ideal location to apply constrained-layer damping which is accomplished by attaching a viscoelastic layer and a constraining layer on opposite sides of each of the blade flexures. The three identical ball-cone flexures provide a damped coupling mechanism to kinematically support the projection optics system of the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) system, or other load-sensitive apparatus.

"An information processing apparatus includes a feature parameter detector for detecting feature parameters based on a plurality of input data, a normalizer for normalizing the feature parameters detected by the feature parameter detector while maintaining their feature components, and an integration unit for integrating the feature parameters normalized by the normalizer. In the information processing apparatus, feature parameters from a plurality of input data are normalized based on learning normalization coefficients, and distances from each of the normalized feature parameters and to a normal parameter are calculated. Based on the calculated distances, time-series normalization coefficients for performing speech recognition are determined for the feature parameters.
